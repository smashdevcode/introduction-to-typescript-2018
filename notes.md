Dr. Strangelove Quotes

In the beginning, shortly after the bomber captain has received and confirmed orders, he gives a short inspirational speech... that could be interesting to cast in a different light: as a dev bringing static typing back to their team, leading the team to victory!

In the middle of the movie, the President asks "Then you mean that it is possible for them to have built such a thing?" to which Dr. Strangelove replies: "Mr. President, the technology required is easily within the means of even the smallest nuclear power. It requires only the will to do so."
